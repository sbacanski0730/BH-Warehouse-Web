## About the project

### **Intro**

The project is inspired by one of the projects I carried out during my studies.
The idea behind this project is to create a web browser tool that will help you manage products in your home cabinets. I chose the theme of making home-made beer as it is a characteristic area with a fairly limited number of types of products.

### **Assumptions**

The website is to allow you to create a new account or log into an existing one.<br>
For the user, the website allows you to view, supervise, add and remove products assigned to his account.

### **Functionalities**

After logging in or registering, the user can manage the status of his products by viewing, adding and removing them.
